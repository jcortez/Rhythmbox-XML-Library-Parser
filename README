What is it?
-----------
Rhythmbox XML Library Parser is what its title implies: a XML parser for a 
Rhythmbox library. It creates Song objects that contain information about
each song obtained from a Rhythmbox library, and they are added to an array
list so that information about every song in a library can be obtained and
manipulated.

How to use
----------
Create a RhythmboxXMLLibraryParser parser and call parseLibrary() on it as 
follows:

RhythmboxXMLLibraryParser parser = new RhythmboxXMLLibraryParser();
parser.parseLibrary();

The parseLibrary() method throws certain exceptions, so they must be handled. 

The constructor RhythmboxXMLLibraryParser() uses the default location for a
Rhythmbox XML library ([user's home]/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml),
but a different location for a library can be specified with the alternate 
constructor:
RhythmboxXMLLibraryParser parser = new RhythmboxXMLLibraryParser("[new location]");

What can be done with a Rhythmbox parser after it parsed a library?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Print out information on every song (title, bitrate, etc.) in a Rhythmbox 
library to System.out:
parser.printLibrary();

Search a Rhythmbox library for a song by title and return its location (a 
SongNotFoundException is thrown if it is not found in the parsed library):
String locationOfYesterday = parser.searchForSongByTitle("Yesterday");

Return an array list of Song objects (songs in a Rhythmbox library) so that
they can be manipulated:
ArrayList<Song> songs = parser.returnSongs();

For example, in order to print all of the titles of songs from a Rhythmbox 
library to System.out, something similar to this will work:
for (int i = 0; i < songs.size(); i++)
{
	System.out.println(songs.get(i).getTitle());
}
